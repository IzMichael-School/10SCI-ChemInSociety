                <p>Group IVA elements include carbon germanium, tin, and lead. Silicon is the fourteenth element on the
                    periodic table. Dark grey in colour, silicon has the same crystalline structure as diamond. This
                    substance has comparable chemical and physical characteristics. 1410° C (2570° F) is the melting
                    point of silicon, whereas 2355° C (4271° F) is the boiling point, and it has a density of 2.33
                    grammes per cubic centimetre.</p>

                <p>A pure form of silicon is extremely rare, yet it is the second most abundant element in the Earth's
                    crust. Silicon, ferrosilicon, and silicon metal are all produced in China, which is by far the
                    world's greatest producer of it. On the worldwide scale, China generated almost two-thirds of the
                    seven million tonnes of silicon manufactured that year, with 4.5 million metric tonnes of silicon
                    produced in 2019. Russia, Norway, and the United States are other important producers.</p>

                <p>Approximately 320,000 metric tonnes of silicon were produced in the United States in 2019. Silicon
                    and silicon metal exports were over 10,000 metric tonnes each. U.S. imports ferrosilicon and silicon
                    metal averaging around 140,000 metric tonnes. Approximately 20 percent of U.S. silicon imports came
                    from Russia between 2015 and 2018.</p>

                <p>A total of 560,000 metric tonnes of silicon were consumed in the United States in 2019. Alloys and
                    other undefined categories utilise silicon in the manufacture of steel and cast iron. Intriguingly,
                    silicon is also the building block for semiconductor polymers, which are ubiquitous. The solar
                    industry relies heavily on polysilicon, a particularly pure type of silicon. In electronics, silicon
                    is commonly used as semiconductors for discrete devices and integrated circuits.</p>

                <h1 class="text-6xl font-bold">Coal - #1</h1>
                <p>Coal has had a huge effect on the world's energy supply since the commencement of industrialisation
                    in the 19th century. Coal is still one of the most important non-renewable energy sources today. In
                    recent years, the usage of hard coal, the most significant form of coal, has even risen a bit. Among
                    all non-renewable energy sources, coal has by far the greatest reserve base.</p>

            <section id="coal2" class="bg-yellow-200">
                <h1 class="text-6xl font-bold">Coal - #2</h1>
                <p>A steady increase in coal output has been observed over the past few years, and in 2019 it reached
                    almost 168 exajoules. Countries that produce the most hard coal include China (first), India
                    (second), the US, Australia (third) and Indonesia (fourth). India's state-owned Coal India Limited
                    produced 606.9 million metric tonnes of coal in 2018/19, making it the world's largest producer.</p>

                <p>Founded in 1975, the firm is among the world's top 10 pollutants. Arch Coal, located in the United
                    States, is another worldwide leader in coal mining, and it was one of the world's most valuable
                    public businesses in March 2020. U.S. coal mining is centred on Appalachian states like West
                    Virginia, Kentucky and Pennsylvania. Wyoming is home to the bulk of the country's largest coal
                    mines.</p>

            <section id="coal4" class="bg-yellow-200">
                <h1 class="text-6xl font-bold">Coal - #4</h1>
                <p>Despite the fact that Central and South America's coal demand grew the most from 2018 to 2019,
                    ambitious economic heavyweights China and India continue to use the bulk of the coal. Coal accounts
                    for 60 percent of China's fast increasing energy demand. Despite a modest decline in coal usage in
                    the United States during the previous decade, other estimates foresee a large increase in coal
                    consumption through 2030.</p>

                <p>Contrasting the two resources, Silicon and Coal, we can see that while silicon is in high demand, it
                    is also being collected sustainably, and efficiently. Coal, on the other hand, is being farmed and
                    used in a way that is harming the world, and in a way that will cause our supplies to expire.</p>
